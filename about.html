    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I originally come from Praia, Cape Verde ever since I was born, but as of right now, I currently live  in Janesville, Wisconsin and have lived there since 2012. I’m currently in Craig Highschool and in 9th Grade. 
        Although I have yet to get a job at the moment, I still do work for many jobs mainly jobs either affiliated with or working in the job, such as Taylor, Marshall’s, DuPont, West-brook, and more.
        As of right now, I am not apart of any sport organizations and likely will not be part of one in the future.</p>
